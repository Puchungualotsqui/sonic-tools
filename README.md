## Stack

- **Go** – backend and routing
- **templ** – HTML templating for Go
- **HTMX** – dynamic content without SPA madness
- **AlpineJS** – only a little JS where needed
- **TailwindCSS + DaisyUI** – styling

## Why?

Go compiles fast, feels simple, and templ+htmx+tailwind made sense to me. Rust because I wanted to try it and it had to be something reliable.
